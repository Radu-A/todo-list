# 📝 ToDo List - My Day

A simple task management app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows you to create, edit, complete, and delete tasks, as well as filter between pending and completed tasks.  
Data is stored in **LocalStorage**, so your tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me practice and deepen my knowledge of:

- DOM manipulation: creating, updating, and removing nodes dynamically.

- Advanced event handling: click, keydown, blur, animationend, and preventing default behaviors.

- LocalStorage persistence: storing and retrieving data across sessions.

- Dynamic IDs and event re-assignment when editing tasks.

- CSS animations integrated with JavaScript logic.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add drag & drop to reorder tasks.

- Implement quick search for tasks.

- Save data to an API/remote server.

- Add dark/light theme support.
